# GoodNotes-Assignment
The code assumes that the fields "flight_id", "flight_no", "Week", "Departure", "Arrival", "Airline", "std_hour" and "flight_date" are present in the testing data. The model handles situations where "delay_time" is either present or absent within the testing data. 
To run the model, simply use:

```shell
python test.py testing_data.csv
```

testing_data.csv can be replaced with the name of the file that contains the testing data. The outputted predictions will be saved in the file output.csv

Please look at the ppt for more information.
